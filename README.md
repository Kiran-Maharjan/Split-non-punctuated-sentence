# Split-non-punctuated-sentence
Given an English text without punctuations, write a sentence tokenizer in Python such that it can mark the end of sentences in the passage. You're free to use regular expression or classifiers or any other method of your choice.  Example input: i am fine how are you Example output: i am fine                          how are you
